# Spotify_Popularity_Classification

This project seeks to classify rap songs as either popular or not based on various features obtained from Spotify's API. 

Items of note in this repository include:
  * **scripts**: These scripts are how I got my data and put it in SQL
  * **Spotify_EDA.ipynb**: Initial analysis of dataset, visualizations, some feature engineering, separated out rap songs from all songs
  * **Rap_Modeling.ipynb**: Handles class imbalance and then proceeds into various models
  * **Rap_Release_Radar_Test.ipynb**: Tests best model on new rap songs from Spotify's release radar playlist
